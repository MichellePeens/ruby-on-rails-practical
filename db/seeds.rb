ArrayRotation.create(name: 'Array Rotation', description: "A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.\nRotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place.\nFor example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).\nThe goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.")
Dominator.create(name: 'Dominator', description: "A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.\nThe dominator of array A is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.")
