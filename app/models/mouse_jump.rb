class MouseJump < CodeProblem

  # A small mouse wants to get to the other side of the road.
  # The mouse is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y.
  # The small mouse always jumps a fixed distance, D.
  # Count the minimal number of jumps that the small mouse must perform to reach its target.
  #
  #
  # Write a function:
  #       def solution(X,  Y, D)
  # that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
  #
  #
  # For example, given:
  #       X = 10
  #       Y = 85
  #       D = 30
  # the function should return 3, because the mouse will be positioned as follows:
  #     after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
  #     after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
  #     after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
  #
  #
  # Assume that:
  #     X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000] and
  #     X â‰¤ Y
  #

  def solution(x, y, d)
